You have done yet another awesome in your meticulous planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to structure and build the complete codebase, start from finalizing the complete database schema design. Then meticulously create an implementation plan to create the well-thought-out complete codebase that is validated. The implementation plan is to create the `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for building the project codebase in logical and independent phases, with a detailed description and a file list with integrated checklist for each phase. Review and validate your plan before proceeding cautiously to create the validated `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for building the project codebase.
